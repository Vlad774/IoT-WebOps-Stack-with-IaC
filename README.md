# IoT WebOps Stack with IaC

## Description

This project builds a cloud-native, IoT-ready architecture with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), optimized for web and IoT applications. It integrates NGINX, Apache Tomcat, RabbitMQ, MySQL, and Dockerized microservices, all managed through IaC tools like Terraform and Ansible for automated provisioning and scalability.

## Key Components

- **NGINX & Load Balancer:** Distribute traffic efficiently across services.
- **Apache Tomcat:** Backend application server for dynamic content.
- **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **MySQL:** Relational database for structured IoT data.
- **Containerized Microservices:** Enable isolated, scalable components.

## Objective

- **Showcase Scalable IoT DevOps Stack:** High-performance, load-balanced architecture for IoT.
- **Implement IaC:** Automate setup, deployment, and scaling.
- **Technical Insights: Delve into the inner workings of LLMs, focusing on parameters and the context window that enables effective communication.**
- **Fine-Tuning Process: Learn how to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, specifically Llama 2 by Meta, using Hugging Face's tools to adapt it for our medical-themed conversations.**
- **Seamless Data Handling:** RabbitMQ and MySQL enable real-time, secure data processing.

## Future Enhancements
- **Monitoring & Security:** Integrate Prometheus and secure protocols.
- **CI/CD Integration:** RabbitMQ and MySQL enable real-time, secure data processing.
